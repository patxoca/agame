=agame= is just a bunch of experiments about game programming, just
for fun and learning.

I've choosen python because I feel comfortable with the language,
being interpreted eases experimentation and I want to focus on just
one challenge at a time. For the graphics, audio etc. I use pygame.

``agame/assets`` directory are distributed with different licenses.
